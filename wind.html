  Wind energy is a unique source of alternative energy because it has the potential to be available all the time and has a minimal footprint.

	There are many different types of wind turbines. There are horizontal axis turbines, vertical axis and darrieus turbines. Others exist but 
	these three are the most common. The horizontal axis wind turbine is the most pervasive. This is the analysis of a horizontal axis 
	wind turbine (HAWT). Power of the HAWT is calculated by a simple equation. Power = half of the mass rate times velocity squared.
	
	$$P = \dfrac{1}{2}{\dot m}V^2$$
	
	This the ideal power. It however, is bounded by a certain number called the Betz limit. This limit is 0.5926 of the available power.
	This value is similiar to an efficiency with solar cells or geothermal.
	Wind energy is an involved subject and there are many factors involved such as the wind speed and tip speed of the edge of the blades.
	The concept of wind profile matching to the power rating of a turbine is also important. Having intelligent integration of an ideal
	turbine and wind environment can provide close to the Betz limit.
	
	In the general sense, wind energy is an underutilized source of energy in North America. Many locations in the midwest and south have strong
	wind profiles with constant wind energy available. However, not all wind profiles are consistent. It is important to locate a specific
	wind profile that is able to keep the turbine running in the constant regime of generating energy. It is counter-intuitive to 
	have a wind turbine run sporadically. This is because there is a cut-in speed for a wind turbine and it requires a small amount of
	energy investment in the turbine itself to move the blades. Ideally a wind turbine will operate indefinitely in the constant regime.
	However, there is a regime where the wind speed is too high so then the turbine enters the cut-off regime. The regimes
	describe the basics of wind turbine power generation. The power coefficent is illustrated below with the maximum value being the Betz limit, 0.5926:

	$$C_{Pmax} = \dfrac{Power_{avail}}{Power_{max}}$$	
	
	Turbines have positives and negatives. Compared to other types of renewable energy sources. Wind turbines have a relatively low cost of 
	investment to build. Once installed they require regular maintenance and operate all throughout the day and night. Some negatives are
	that the turbines need to be installed far away from major obstacles and terrain. This decreases the efficiency of
	transferring energy from a distant installation. Additionally, the larger turbines can be considered to decrease property value of nearby 
	land. Overall, wind turbines are complex energy generators with many factors to consider.
